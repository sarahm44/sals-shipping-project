## Overview
I was required to write a Python program for Sal's Shipping.

The program: 
1. Asks the user for the weight of their package;
2. Tells them which method of shipping is cheapest; and
3. Tells them how much it will cost to ship their package using Sal’s Shippers.

## Shipping Options
Sal’s Shippers has several different options for a customer to ship their package:
* Ground Shipping, which is a small flat charge plus a rate based on the weight of your package.
* Ground Shipping Premium, which is a much higher flat charge, but you aren’t charged for weight.
* Drone Shipping (new), which has no flat charge, but the rate based on weight is triple the rate of ground shipping.

## Pricing Structure
### Ground Shipping

| Weight of Package | Price per Pound | Flat Charge |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 2 lb or less | $1.50 | $20.00 |
| Over 2 lb but less than or equal to 6 lb	| $3.00	| $20.00 |
| Over 6 lb but less than or equal to 10 lb	| $4.00	| $20.00 |
| Over 10 lb	| $4.75	| $20.00 |

### Ground Shipping Premium
Flat charge: $125.00

### Drone Shipping
| Weight of Package	| Price per Pound	| Flat Charge |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 2 lb or less	| $4.50	| $0.00 |
| Over 2 lb but less than or equal to 6 lb	| $9.00	| $0.00 |
| Over 6 lb but less than or equal to 10 lb	| $12.00	| $0.00 |
| Over 10 lb	| $14.25	| $0.00 |
