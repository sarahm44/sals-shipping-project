# Codecademy Project: Sal's Shipping
## Overview
I was required to write a Python program for Sal's Shipping.

The program: 
1. Asks the user for the weight of their package;
2. Tells them which method of shipping is cheapest; and
3. Tells them how much it will cost to ship their package using Sal’s Shippers.

## Shipping Options
Sal’s Shippers has several different options for a customer to ship their package:
* Ground Shipping, which is a small flat charge plus a rate based on the weight of your package.
* Ground Shipping Premium, which is a much higher flat charge, but you aren’t charged for weight.
* Drone Shipping (new), which has no flat charge, but the rate based on weight is triple the rate of ground shipping.

## Python Program
The file *INSERT* contains the Python Program to help Sal's Shipping customers select the best option for their shipping needs.
